# Auto Update App

Deploying an application for a client outside of any app store and need a auto update feature ?

This repo showcase how to implement it as simpliest as possible.

If you want to test the feature, install this app [V 0.0.1 release](https://github.com/bienvenuelisis/auto_update_app/releases/download/0.0.1/app-release.apk).

## Limitations

When running this project in debug, you can't install the app latest version (if you didn't change the app file url in assets folder), because SHA key used to build release app and your debug build SHA key are differents.
